            body: "The IB is a widely recognized international program focused on promoting internationality in education. In my case, I took it alongside the regular Spanish baccalaureate, completing two baccalaureates at the same time. There, I developed skills in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics, as well as in research and writing scientific articles. My monograph (the final baccalaureate project) focused on statistical analysis. Specifically, it deals with the European Union's carbon emissions and their alignment with the targets proposed by the Kyoto Protocol."
